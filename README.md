# Flower-Classification-Computer-Vision-Project
Flower Classification Computer Vision CNN, ResNet &amp; Deployment Using Gradio ==> In this use case we build model to classify the flower class or category using computer vision techniques such as CNN &amp; ResNet, after building those models, we can clearly see that ResNet model has improved validation accuracy which is close to 90%,but CNN has only 62%. So we conclude that ResNet outperform the CNN model,  we use for our problem "ResNet model" for classification of flowers & deployment using gradio, we create GUI (Graphical User Interface) using "Gradio" & after deployment using gradio, model is able to detect the correct class of flower(daisy, dendelion, sunflower, roses, tulips)  !!!
